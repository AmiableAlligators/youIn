# YouIn

> YouIn allows users to coordinate hanging out more easily than ever before.  Bring an end to the hassle of having multiple text conversations to see if people are in, or out.  With the click, a user can create and invite friends to any spontaneous event they want to do.  Those friends get an invite and with one click say whether they're in, or they're out.  You in?
